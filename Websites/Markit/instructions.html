                Then press the ADD button.You can continue this process as many times as you would like.
                Once you are done, press the plot button to have your markers appear on the map. 
                To view the latitude and longitude of the marker, simply click on the marker.

            <p class="info">If you would like to plot multiple points quickly, you can also upload a file.
                 The file should be organized in the same way as plotting an individual point; latitude, longitude, colour, 
                 and the size of the marker. Each of these elements needs to be separated by a comma for this to work.
                 It is important to note that you can still add points using the ADD button after you have uploaded a file. 
                 Below is an example of how the file could look. I prefer to keep each point on its own line, however it 
                 is not necessary.
