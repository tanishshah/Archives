This is my attempt at making a program that tracks the ISS and then maps its data to using basemap 

the api I used
http://open-notify.org/

*****
Please note that becuase I hard coded in the values for longitude and latitude there will be times when an incorrect value is displayed
I am working on fixing this bug. Temporary fixes include changing the hard coded values but I plan on having a permanent fix soon

I am currently busy with school so I am not sure when I will be able to edit this program but I will try on having something up soon

***** 
UPDATE
I have made some changes to the code where it now converts the data to a list. It is still hard coded in that I directly input which values in the list contain the longitude and latitude.As a result I am not sure whether this will solve the original problem. However, it is an improvement to the previous version an I am will try to fix this soon.

*****
UPDATE
I have an updated version of the program which should account for the changes in how the api sends information. I am not sure if all of the problems have been fixed but there are no more hard coded value.
