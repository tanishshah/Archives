This is a project that I made as a first step towards a smart plant project 

There are a few important things to note

1. The sensor used to meausre the soil moisture isn't a soil moisture sensor but is actually a water level sensor so its accuracy is much less than a proper sensor

2. The readings from the thermistor are converted using the Steinheart-Hart equation but the vales for calculating the coeffecients were quite close together, once again hurting accuracy

3. Due to difficulties in converting sensor data to standard units a table has been provided in this folder to allow one to roughly compare what the sensor values relate to

4. I would like to give credit to adafruit as I am using there library

Please note that this is a work in progress and that I know that there are many ways in which this project can be improved.
